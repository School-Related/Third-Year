\section{Aim}
Write server-side script in PHP to perform form validation and create database application
using PHP and MySQL to perform insert, update, delete and search operations.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To understand Server-side Scripting.
    \item To learn database connectivity using PHP-MySQL.
    \item To perform insert, update, delete and search operations on database.
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem Statement}
PHP CRUD Operations\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Student can create a PHP form or use existing/ implemented HTML form for Studentâ€™s
          Registration System with the fields mentioned: First name,Last name, Roll No/ID, Password,
          Confirm Password,Contact number and perform following operations
    \item Insert student details -First name,Last name, Roll No/ID, Password, Confirm Password,Contact
          number
    \item Delete the Student records based on Roll no/ID
    \item Update the Student details based on Roll no/ID- Example students can update their contact
          details based on searching the record with Roll no.
    \item Display the Updated student details or View the Students record in tabular format.
\end{enumerate}
Apply Form Validation on the necessary fields using PHP/Javascript

\section{Theory}
\section{PHP}

\begin{dfn}
    PHP stands for \textbf{Hypertext Preprocessor}. It is a widely-used open-source scripting language primarily designed for web development. PHP is embedded within HTML code and executed on the server-side to generate dynamic web pages.
\end{dfn}

\subsection{Features}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Server-Side Scripting:} PHP is a server-side scripting language, which means it is executed on the web server before the web page is sent to the client's browser.
    \item \textbf{Cross-Platform Compatibility:} PHP is compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, making it highly versatile.
    \item \textbf{Database Integration:} PHP offers robust support for database integration, allowing developers to interact with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more.
    \item \textbf{Extensive Library Support:} PHP has a vast standard library and a thriving community of developers, resulting in a rich ecosystem of extensions and libraries.
    \item \textbf{Open Source:} PHP is open-source software, which means it's free to use, modify, and distribute, contributing to its widespread adoption.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Advantages}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Ease of Learning:} PHP has a relatively low learning curve, making it accessible to beginners in web development.
    \item \textbf{Wide Adoption:} PHP is one of the most commonly used languages for web development, ensuring ample resources and community support.
    \item \textbf{Rapid Development:} PHP's simplicity and numerous built-in functions facilitate rapid web application development.
    \item \textbf{Platform Independence:} PHP can run on various platforms, ensuring compatibility with different hosting environments.
    \item \textbf{Active Community:} A large and active PHP community continually updates and enhances the language and its ecosystem.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{History and Significance}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Origins:} PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 as a set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in C. It was initially a simple tool for tracking visits to his online resume.
    \item \textbf{PHP 3 and Beyond:} PHP 3, released in 1997, introduced a new parser written in C and marked the transition to a more robust scripting language. Subsequent versions, like PHP 4 and PHP 5, added essential features and improvements.
    \item \textbf{PHP 7:} PHP 7, released in 2015, brought substantial performance improvements, making PHP even more attractive for web development.
    \item \textbf{Significance:} PHP has played a crucial role in the development of dynamic web applications and websites. It powers a substantial portion of the internet, from small personal blogs to large-scale e-commerce platforms.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Platform}
\textbf{Operating System}: Arch Linux x86-64 \\
\textbf{IDEs or Text Editors Used}: Visual Studio Code\\
\textbf{Compilers or Interpreters}: Brave Browser (Chromium v117.0.5938.88.) \\

\section{Input and Output}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A Library Interface called 'Novel Tea' Library was set up on the front end usign React. Its Back end was then written in PHP, and the database was set up using Mariadb.
    \item The Front end was hosted on another locolhost port, while the php server was hosted using httpd, and default php server.
    \item The Front end was then connected to the backend using the simple FETCH API or Axios calls, and the data was sent to the backend using JSON. The responses were also sent from the backend to the Frontend using JSON.
    \item The Features of the Library include, and therefore extend to the backend:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Adding a Book to the Library
              \item Removing a Book from the Library
              \item Updating a Book in the Library
              \item Searching for a Book in the Library
              \item Getting all the Books from the library to display.
          \end{enumerate}
    \item These features are demonstrated in the screenshots below.
\end{enumerate}
