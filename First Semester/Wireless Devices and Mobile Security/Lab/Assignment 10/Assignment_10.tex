            at rest and in transit. Full-disk encryption ensures that data stored on the
            device remains protected even if it is lost or stolen.

      \item Keystore: Android provides a secure keystore for storing cryptographic keys and
            other sensitive data. This mechanism protects against unauthorized access to
            sensitive information.

      \item Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux): SELinux is a mandatory access control
            framework that enforces fine-grained security policies, restricting app access
            to system resources and preventing unauthorized actions.

      \item Trusty TEE: Trusty is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that provides a
            secure enclave for sensitive operations, such as secure boot and cryptographic
            key management.

      \item Verified Boot: Verified boot verifies the integrity of the Android system
            before booting, ensuring that the device has not been tampered with.

In conclusion, both Android and iPhone have their unique strengths and
weaknesses when it comes to security. Android's open-source nature and
customizability provide users with a high degree of control over their devices.
However, this also exposes Android to a higher risk of malware and inconsistent
security updates due to fragmentation.

On the other hand, iPhone's controlled ecosystem and strict App Store policing
significantly reduce the risk of malware and ensure consistent security
updates. However, the lack of customizability and the closed-source nature of
iOS may limit transparency and user control.

Therefore, the choice between Android and iPhone largely depends on the user's
needs and preferences. Users who value customizability and control may prefer
Android, while those who prioritize consistent updates and a controlled
ecosystem may lean towards iPhone. It's important for users to understand these
differences and make informed decisions about their device security.
