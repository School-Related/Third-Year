\section{Aim}
Write a Web Service using Java or Python. Deploy the services using PaaS tools such as
Cloud Foundry/ GoogleAppEngine / OpenShift.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To understand the concept of web service.
    \item To get familiar with PaaS Service.
    \item Learn how to deploy the web service on cloud Foundry/GoogleAppEngine/ OpenShift
\end{enumerate}

\section{Theory}

\section{Introduction to Web services}

Web services are software systems designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. They are built on standard web technologies such as HTTP, XML, and SOAP, and can be accessed using standard protocols like REST, JSON, and WSDL. Web services provide a platform-independent way of integrating applications and services across different platforms and technologies.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Web Service Architecture:} Web services follow a client-server architecture, where the client sends requests to the server, and the server processes the requests and sends back responses. The communication between the client and server is done using standard protocols like HTTP, SOAP, or REST.
    \item \textbf{Web Service Standards:} Web services are built on standard web technologies and protocols, such as XML, SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI. These standards define the message format, communication protocols, and service description for web services, ensuring interoperability and compatibility across different platforms and technologies.
    \item \textbf{Web Service Security:} Web services need to be secure to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. Security mechanisms like SSL/TLS, OAuth, and WS-Security can be used to secure web services and ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.
    \item \textbf{Web Service Deployment:} Web services can be deployed on different platforms, such as on-premises servers, cloud platforms, or PaaS services. Deployment involves configuring the web service, setting up the server environment, and making the service accessible to clients over the network.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Web Service Protocols}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):} SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It uses XML as the message format and can be accessed using standard protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and TCP.
    \item \textbf{REST (Representational State Transfer):} REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful web services use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources. They typically use JSON or XML as the message format and are lightweight and easy to use.
    \item \textbf{WSDL (Web Services Description Language):} WSDL is an XML-based language for describing web services and their interfaces. It defines the operations, messages, and bindings of a web service and provides a standard way to communicate with the service.
    \item \textbf{UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration):} UDDI is a standard for publishing and discovering web services. It provides a directory service where businesses can register their web services and clients can search for and access the services.
    \item \textbf{HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):} HTTP is the standard protocol for transferring data over the web. It is used by web services to send and receive messages between clients and servers.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Web Service Standards}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{XML (Extensible Markup Language):} XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is widely used in web services for representing data in a structured and standardized way.
    \item \textbf{JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):} JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used in RESTful web services for data serialization and exchange.
    \item \textbf{SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security):} SSL/TLS are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over a computer network. They are used to encrypt data transmitted between clients and servers, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
    \item \textbf{OAuth (Open Authorization):} OAuth is an open standard for access delegation that allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing their credentials. It is commonly used in web services to authenticate and authorize users.
    \item \textbf{WS-Security (Web Services Security):} WS-Security is a standard for securing web services using message-level security mechanisms. It provides features like encryption, digital signatures, and authentication to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages.
    \item \textbf{HTTP Methods:} HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are used in RESTful web services to perform operations on resources. GET is used to retrieve data, POST is used to create data, PUT is used to update data, and DELETE is used to delete data.
    \item \textbf{HTTP Status Codes:} HTTP status codes like 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, and 404 Not Found are used in web services to indicate the status of a request. They provide information about the success or failure of a request and help clients understand the response from the server.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Different types of Web services}

Web services can be categorized into two main types:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{SOAP-based Web Services:} SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. SOAP-based web services use XML as the message format and can be accessed using standard protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and TCP.
    \item \textbf{RESTful Web Services:} REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful web services use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources. They typically use JSON or XML as the message format and are lightweight and easy to use.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{SOAP}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Description:} SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It uses XML as the message format and can be accessed using standard protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and TCP.

It relies on XML for message format and typically uses WSDL (Web Services Description Language) for service description.
                        \item \textbf{RESTful (Representational State Transfer):} RESTful web services are based on the REST architectural style, which emphasizes a stateless client-server interaction, uniform resource identifiers (URIs) for resource identification, and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication.
                    \end{itemize}
              \item \textbf{Communication Protocols:}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{SOAP:} SOAP typically uses HTTP or SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) as the communication protocol. It can also work with other protocols such as TCP/IP and JMS (Java Message Service).
                        \item \textbf{RESTful:} RESTful web services primarily use HTTP as the communication protocol. They leverage standard HTTP methods and status codes for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
                    \end{itemize}
              \item \textbf{Data Formats:}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{SOAP:} SOAP messages are typically formatted using XML (eXtensible Markup Language). They can also support other data formats such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and MTOM (Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism) for binary data.
                        \item \textbf{RESTful:} RESTful web services can support various data formats, including XML, JSON, HTML, and plain text. The choice of data format is typically based on the client's requirements and preferences.
                    \end{itemize}
